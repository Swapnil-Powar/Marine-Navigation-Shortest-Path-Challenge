## Problem Analysis

The marine navigation shortest path problem is a constrained optimization problem with the following key characteristics:

1. **Ordered Gateway Traversal**: Must visit gateway segments in alphabetical order (A-B before C-D, etc.)
2. **Orientation Constraint**: Must maintain proper left/right orientation relative to travel direction
3. **Geometric Constraints**: Path must keep all left points on the left side and right points on the right side
4. **Optimization Goal**: Find the shortest Euclidean distance path satisfying all constraints

## Algorithm Overview

### 1. Visibility Graph Construction

The solution uses a visibility graph approach where:

- **Nodes**: All gateway segment endpoints plus start and end points
- **Edges**: Valid connections between nodes that satisfy all constraints
- **Weights**: Euclidean distances between connected nodes

### 2. Constraint Validation

For each potential edge between nodes, we validate:

#### Ordering Constraint
```cpp
bool respects_ordering_constraint(const GraphNode& from, const GraphNode& to) 
{
    return from.segment_order <= to.segment_order;
}
```

#### Orientation Constraint
```cpp
bool respects_orientation_constraint(const GraphNode& from, const GraphNode& to, const std::vector<Segment>& segments) 
{
    for (const auto& segment : segments) 
    {
        double cross_left = cross_product(from.point, to.point, segment.left);
        double cross_right = cross_product(from.point, to.point, segment.right);
        if (cross_left <= 0 || cross_right >= 0) 
        {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

#### Visibility Constraint
Uses GEOS library to check for geometric intersections and ensure no inappropriate segment crossings.

### 3. Shortest Path Algorithm

Uses Dijkstra's algorithm on the constructed visibility graph:

```cpp
PathResult solve(const std::vector<Segment>& segments, const Point& start, const Point& end) 
{
    graph_.build_graph(segments, start, end);
    std::priority_queue<DijkstraNode> pq;
    std::vector<double> distances(num_nodes, infinity);
    std::vector<int> previous(num_nodes, -1);
    return reconstruct_path(previous, start_idx, end_idx);
}
```

## Time Complexity Analysis

### Visibility Graph Construction: O(n²)
- **Node Creation**: O(n) where n is the number of gateway points
- **Edge Validation**: O(n²) pairs × O(k) constraint checks where k is the number of segments
- **Overall**: O(n² × k) ≈ O(n²) since k ≈ n/2

### Shortest Path: O(n² log n)
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: O((V + E) log V) where V = n nodes, E ≤ n² edges
- **Path Reconstruction**: O(n)
- **Overall**: O(n² log n)

### Total Complexity: O(n² log n)

This complexity is excellent for the target scale of millions of segments, as:
- For n = 2,000,000 points (1M segments): ~2×10¹³ operations
- Modern CPUs can handle this in reasonable time with optimizations

## Scalability Optimizations

### 1. Spatial Indexing
For very large datasets, implement spatial indexing:
```cpp
class SpatialIndex {};
```

### 2. Constraint Pre-filtering
```cpp
bool quick_constraint_check(const Point& from, const Point& to) {}
```

### 3. Parallel Processing
```cpp
#pragma omp parallel for
for (int i = 0; i < nodes.size(); ++i) 
{
    for (int j = i + 1; j < nodes.size(); ++j) 
    {
        if (can_connect_nodes(nodes[i], nodes[j], segments)) 
        {
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Memory Optimization
- Use sparse adjacency representation
- Implement custom memory pools for frequent allocations
- Consider memory-mapped files for very large datasets

## Geometric Considerations

### Cross Product for Orientation
```cpp
double cross_product(const Point& a, const Point& b, const Point& c) 
{
    return (b.x - a.x) * (c.y - a.y) - (b.y - a.y) * (c.x - a.x);
}
```

- **Positive**: Point c is to the left of line ab
- **Negative**: Point c is to the right of line ab
- **Zero**: Point c is on line ab

### GEOS Integration
The solution leverages GEOS for:
- Line intersection detection
- Complex geometric predicates
- Robust floating-point geometry operations

## Validation and Testing

### Path Validation
```cpp
bool validate_path(const std::vector<Point>& path, const std::vector<Segment>& segments) {}
```

### Test Cases
- Simple cases with few segments
- Complex cases with many intersecting possibilities
- Edge cases (collinear points, identical coordinates)
- Performance tests with large datasets
